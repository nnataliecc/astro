# Astronaut Sleep Disruption and Stress Indicators

## Motivation
Long-duration space missions involve isolation, workload, and sleep disruption-- all of which can impact psychological well-being

## Research Question
How do sleep disruption and mission duration relate to reported stress indicators in astronauts?

## Data
Public Data from NASA Human Research Program

## Methods
- SQL for data cleaning and aggregation
- Python for analysis and visualization

## Results
Key trends suggest changes in sleep patterns over mission duration
and associations with stress-related measures.

## Limitations
Small sample sizes and reliance on proxy.

## Relevance
Importance of mental health support systems for missions with limited access to real-time care.
